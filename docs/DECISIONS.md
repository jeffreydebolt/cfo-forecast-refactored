## Decisions Made

### 2025-07-29 - AI Chat Interface for Forecast Analysis
**Status**: Approved  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Decision**: AI Chat Interface for Forecast Analysis  
**Reasoning**: Add conversational AI that can answer questions about forecasts, explain patterns, and provide insights using natural language  
**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Static reports only - Less interactive, harder for users to get specific answers
2. Pre-built dashboard widgets - Limited to predefined questions, not flexible enough

---

### 2025-07-29 - Web-based UI with FastAPI backend
**Status**: Approved  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Decision**: Web-based UI with FastAPI backend  
**Reasoning**: Provides best flexibility for multi-client access, easier deployment, and modern user experience. Can be accessed from anywhere without installation.  
**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Desktop application - Harder to deploy updates, platform-specific issues
2. Keep Streamlit only - Performance limitations, not suitable for production

---

### 2025-01-29 - Documentation as Infrastructure
**Status**: Approved  
**Category**: Process  
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive documentation system before any feature development  
**Reasoning**: 
- Current codebase lacks proper documentation
- Multiple files with unclear purposes
- Need to maintain context across development sessions
- Reduces onboarding time for new developers

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Document as we go - Rejected: Often leads to incomplete documentation
2. Document after refactoring - Rejected: Loses important context and decisions

**Trade-offs**:
- Pros: Better knowledge preservation, easier collaboration, reduced technical debt
- Cons: Upfront time investment, requires discipline to maintain

**Impact**: All development must update relevant documentation files

### 2025-01-28 - Supabase as Primary Database
**Status**: Approved (Existing)  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Decision**: Use Supabase (PostgreSQL) as the primary database  
**Reasoning**:
- Provides real-time capabilities
- Built-in authentication (for future use)
- Managed PostgreSQL with good developer experience
- RESTful API out of the box

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Raw PostgreSQL - More control but more maintenance
2. MongoDB - Better for unstructured data but less suitable for financial data
3. SQLite - Too limited for multi-client architecture

**Trade-offs**:
- Pros: Managed service, built-in features, good scalability
- Cons: Vendor lock-in, potential latency, cost at scale

---

### 2025-01-28 - OpenAI for Vendor Normalization
**Status**: Approved (Existing)  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Decision**: Use OpenAI GPT-4 and embeddings for vendor name normalization  
**Reasoning**:
- Superior understanding of vendor name variations
- Embeddings provide semantic similarity for clustering
- Reduces manual mapping effort significantly

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Rule-based system - Too rigid, high maintenance
2. Fuzzy string matching - Limited accuracy for complex variations
3. Open-source LLMs - Lower quality results for this use case

**Trade-offs**:
- Pros: High accuracy, low maintenance, handles edge cases well
- Cons: API costs, dependency on external service, rate limits

---

### 2025-01-28 - Streamlit for Dashboards
**Status**: Approved (Existing)  
**Category**: Tools  
**Decision**: Use Streamlit for all interactive dashboards  
**Reasoning**:
- Rapid development of data-centric UIs
- Python-native (same language as backend)
- Good for internal tools and MVPs

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. React/Next.js - Overkill for internal tools
2. Flask/Django - More boilerplate for simple dashboards
3. Dash - Less intuitive API than Streamlit

**Trade-offs**:
- Pros: Fast development, easy to maintain, good for data viz
- Cons: Limited customization, not ideal for complex UIs, performance limitations

## Pending Decisions

### Module Structure Reorganization
**Status**: Pending  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Decision Needed**: How to organize the 40+ files into a proper module structure  
**Options**:
1. Domain-based (forecasting/, data/, ui/, etc.)
2. Layer-based (models/, services/, controllers/, etc.)
3. Feature-based (vendor_management/, forecasting/, reporting/, etc.)

**Considerations**:
- Current code coupling
- Future scalability needs
- Developer familiarity

---

### Testing Framework Selection
**Status**: Pending  
**Category**: Tools  
**Decision Needed**: Which testing framework to use  
**Options**:
1. pytest - Most popular, good plugin ecosystem
2. unittest - Built-in, familiar to Java developers
3. nose2 - Good test discovery but less maintained

---

### Caching Strategy
**Status**: Pending  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Decision Needed**: How to implement caching for API calls and computations  
**Options**:
1. Redis - Industry standard, good for distributed systems
2. In-memory Python cache - Simpler but doesn't scale
3. Supabase caching - Keep everything in one system

## Guidelines for Future Decisions

1. **Prioritize maintainability** over clever solutions
2. **Choose boring technology** when possible
3. **Minimize external dependencies** for core functionality
4. **Document extensively** for complex logic
5. **Design for testability** from the start
6. **Consider operational complexity** not just development ease
