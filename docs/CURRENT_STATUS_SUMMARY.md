# CFO Forecast Refactored - Current Status Summary

## Date: July 30, 2025

## Progress Completed Today

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Review
1. **Progress Tracker Module**: Verified the utils/progress_tracker.py module is fully implemented and working
2. **File Structure Analysis**: Created comprehensive refactoring plan to organize 60+ root files into proper modules
3. **Client ID Audit**: Identified 20 files with hardcoded client references that need refactoring
4. **Weekly Cash Flow Testing**: Confirmed the weekly cash flow functionality is working correctly

## Current State

### Working Features
- Multi-client support via ClientContext system
- Universal CSV import framework (5 bank formats)
- Weekly cash flow projections
- Progress tracking and documentation system
- CLI with comprehensive commands

### Technical Debt Identified
1. **File Organization**: 60+ Python files in root directory need to be organized into:
   - src/ (core application code)
   - scripts/ (one-off analysis and utilities)
   - web/ (UI components)
   - tests/ (test suite)

2. **Hardcoded Client IDs**: 20 files still use hardcoded client values ('spyguy', 'bestself')
   - Need to integrate with ClientContext system
   - Special note: Some data appears to be cross-referenced between clients

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Create New Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p src/{api,database,ai}
mkdir -p scripts/{analysis,setup,debug,migration}
mkdir -p web/{streamlit,static}
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,fixtures}
```

### 2. Move Core Components
- supabase_client.py → src/database/
- openai_client.py → src/ai/
- Update imports across all files

### 3. Fix Hardcoded Client References
- Start with core analysis scripts
- Implement consistent client parameter handling
- Add validation to prevent future hardcoding

### 4. Design Configuration System
- Centralized settings management
- Environment-based configuration
- Client-specific overrides

## Recent Activity Log
- Generated multiple cash flow projections for clients
- Imported transaction data from Mercury CSV files
- Created new clients via CLI
- Tested multi-client switching functionality

## Known Issues
- BestSelf data appears to be stored under 'spyguy' client ID
- Some scripts have implicit client assumptions
- No automated tests yet implemented

## Recommendations
1. Prioritize file structure refactoring to improve maintainability
2. Implement automated tests before major refactoring
3. Create migration scripts for client data consolidation
4. Add pre-commit hooks to enforce coding standards
