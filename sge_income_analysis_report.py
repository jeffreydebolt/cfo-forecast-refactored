    print("\n📊 INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:")
    
    print("\n1. VENDOR CONFIGURATION:")
    print("   - Vendor Name: SGE Income (Mercury Checking xx9292)")
    print("   - Display Name: Internal Revenue")
    print("   - Category: Internal Transfers")
    print("   - Is Revenue: TRUE")
    print("   - Current Forecast: $3,862.50 MONTHLY")
    print("   - Forecast Method: trailing_avg")
    
    print("\n2. TRANSACTION ANALYSIS (Last 12 months):")
    print("   - Total transactions: 184")
    print("   - Total amount: $368,653.53")
    print("   - Average per transaction: $2,003.55")
    print("   - Transaction frequency: Nearly daily (1.94 txns/day)")
    
    print("\n3. RECENT WEEKLY REVENUE PATTERN:")
    print("   - Week of 2025-04-28: $6,000.00")
    print("   - Week of 2025-04-21: $9,600.00")
    print("   - Week of 2025-04-14: $22,200.00") 
    print("   - Week of 2025-03-17: $6,700.00")
    print("   - 4-week average: $11,125.00/week")
    
    print("\n4. TRAILING AVERAGE CALCULATIONS:")
    print("   - 90-day average: $3,862.50 per transaction")
    print("   - Number of transactions in 90 days: 16")
    print("   - 90-day weekly forecast: $901.25")
    
    print("\n❌ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:")
    
    print("\n1. FREQUENCY MISCLASSIFICATION:")
    print("   - Algorithm treats this as MONTHLY payments")
    print("   - Reality: This is DAILY revenue stream")
    print("   - Problem: Using 'payment_day' logic for revenue")
    
    print("\n2. CALCULATION METHOD ERROR:")
    print("   - Current: Average transaction amount × 1 (monthly)")
    print("   - Should be: Daily revenue total × 7 (weekly)")
    print("   - Missing: Revenue aggregation by day/week")
    
    print("\n3. REVENUE VS EXPENSE LOGIC:")
    print("   - SGE Income is marked as revenue (is_revenue=TRUE)")
    print("   - But forecast logic treats it like expense payments")
    print("   - Revenue should be forecasted by daily/weekly totals")
    
    print("\n✅ RECOMMENDED FIXES:")
    
    print("\n1. IMMEDIATE FIX - Update Forecast Amount:")
    print("   - Change from $3,862.50 monthly to weekly")
    print("   - Based on 4-week average: $11,125/week")
    print("   - More conservative 12-week average needed")
    
    print("\n2. ALGORITHM ENHANCEMENT:")
    print("   - Add revenue-specific forecasting logic")
    print("   - For is_revenue=TRUE vendors:")
    print("     * Group transactions by day")
    print("     * Calculate daily revenue totals")
    print("     * Use weekly/monthly aggregation")
    print("     * Don't use 'payment_day' concept")
    
    print("\n3. FREQUENCY DETECTION:")
    print("   - Detect daily revenue patterns")
    print("   - If transactions > 15/month, classify as 'daily'")
    print("   - Use daily total averages, not transaction averages")
    
    print("\n📈 CORRECTED FORECAST CALCULATION:")
    print("\n   Current Algorithm:")
    print("   - Takes 90-day transaction average: $3,862.50")
    print("   - Assumes monthly frequency")
    print("   - Weekly forecast: $3,862.50 ÷ 4.33 = $892/week")
    
    print("\n   Corrected Algorithm:")
    print("   - Group by day, sum daily totals")
    print("   - Recent 4-week daily average: $1,589/day")
    print("   - Weekly forecast: $1,589 × 7 = $11,125/week")
    print("   - Monthly forecast: $11,125 × 4.33 = $48,171/month")
    
    print("\n🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:")
    print("   1. HIGH: Update SGE Income forecast_amount to weekly")
    print("   2. MEDIUM: Enhance revenue forecasting logic")
    print("   3. LOW: Add daily revenue pattern detection")
